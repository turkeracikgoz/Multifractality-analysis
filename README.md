# Multifractal analysis of Turkish stock market

In this project, i will work on multifractal structure of Turkish stock market. Theoretically, financial markets are assumed to be efficient in most cases. However, it may not be realistic assumption many times. In this project, I will apply MFDFA analysis of Kantelhardt et al. (2002) to test market efficientcy in BIST100 index.
